# StealthMax

A non-warp Nevermore Max Frame. Smaller, less parts/assembly, easier sourcing. Uses standard bolts, easily available GPU fan (BFB0712HF, Nevermore branded version [HERE](https://www.onetwo3d.co.uk/product/nevermore-bfb0712hf-65mm-fan/?wpam_id=2)(UK), [HERE](https://www.replimat.eu/nevermore-bfb0712hf-fan-65mm/rt10136)(DE) and [HERE](https://kb-3d.com/store/fans/983-nevermore-65mm-blower-cage-fan-for-stealthmax-1694204852771.html)(US). It also supports the [Sanyo C70](https://products.sanyodenki.com/en/sanace/dc/centrifugal-fan/9TD12P6G001/) (requires printing the casing pieces mirrored as it spins the opposite direction). <BR>Compared to the regular Max v2 beta, Stealthmax also adds an exhaust option (handy for keeping the chamber cool for PLA or PETG). The HEPA filter has moved into the center hub in order to shrink the overall size (now uses Xiaomi Mijia G1 130x40mm hepa filters).<BR><BR>
So far theres no official build guide, so please check out a) the CAD file that has every bolt, nook and cranny, b) the wiring guide on the [nevermore controller](https://github.com/SanaaHamel/nevermore-controller) github, and c) the [Nevermore Discord server](https://discord.gg/H8tZ9fZVQ4) for any additional questions regarding your build or software.

# Bill of Materials and Sourcing Guide
## Things to buy
This is a list of all the required parts. The links to items on this page are **affiliate links** that will share a few per cent of the sales price with the nevermore project at no additional cost to the user, we'd be thrilled if you use them! We do not, however, have any affiliations/contacts with the stores themselves, reach out if there are any bad experiences so we can remove such links.<br><br>Also, do feel free to source everything elsewhere to your custom desires, but before placing any orders, please make sure you covered the details for sourcing in the next section!<br><br> As a final - and most comfortable - sourcing route, feel free to try the awesome [Advanced Stealthmax Kit by OneTwo3d](https://www.onetwo3d.co.uk/product/nevermore-stealthmax-filter-kit/?wpam_id=2), containing everything needed for the stealthmax in one order, including two XL bags of Nevermore Carbon. A [Basic Stealthmax Kit](https://www.onetwo3d.co.uk/product/nevermore-stealthmax-filter-kit-basic/?wpam_id=2) without electronics is now also available.<br>

**NOTE: A power source to the stealthmax is not included in the BOM. You would either need a spare 12v power adapter (at least 1A, preferable >=1.5A) or a single dc male plug to run 12v wires (why no the same awg26 as the bom) to your 12v source (usually a voltage selectable fan port in your printer electronics).**
