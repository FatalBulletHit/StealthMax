## Legacy Files
### Looking for Older StealthMax Files?
Do you want to print replacements parts for an existing StealthMax or simply prefer the older version? <br>
The files you are looking for can still be accessed from a previous branch of the StealthMax repository.

The last branch before the StealthMax repository was restructured and various quality of life enhancements were implemented is [`03943a1`](https://github.com/nevermore3d/StealthMax/tree/03943a1d3c7519fd73a51dbf063abd58a43e0050).
<br><br>
### What's a Branch?
GitHub provides the capability to explore [repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) at earlier points in time through the creation of new [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) for each [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits). <br>
This allows you to still access the old CAD and STL files.
